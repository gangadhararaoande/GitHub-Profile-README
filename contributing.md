# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Create an [issue](https://github.com/gangadhararaoande/GitHub-Profile-README/issue), with the title as your name, and in the description put a screenshot of the customized GitHub profile page in the assets/screenshots/ (This will be needed in the next step)
- Fork the project, using the top right corner button, that states `fork`
- In the `script.js` file, add your own object to the **end of the file**. Your entry should be similar to this example:
``` {
    categoryName: "Category Name",
    list: [
      {
        githubUrl: "Your Github README URL",
        nickName: "Your Name",
        filePath: "assets/screenshots/yourprofileimg.png",
        timestamp: convertToTimestamp("Date(06/03/2024) Time(16:32)"),
      },
    ],
  },```
- Suggested Github Profile READMEs should be beautiful or stand out in some way.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Can suggest for different categories as well.
- Start the Name with a capital.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

Thank you for your suggestions!
